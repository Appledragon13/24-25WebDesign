                The Doofenshmirtz family lived in Gimmelshtump, and when they came across lean times, their beloved lawn gnome was repossessed. Since it was necessary to protect the zatzenfruit garden against "witches’ spells and wood trolls", his father dressed Heinz up as a gnome and forced him to stand watch for hours at a time during the day and night. Any time Heinz tried to move, such as when friends came by to play "Kick the Schtumpel", to eat Doonkleberries or to wave at his neighbor Kenny, his father was right there, yelling at him "Bewegen Sie nicht!" ("Don't move!").

                    At Heinz's birth, neither of his parents were present for the birth of their son. At five years old, Heinz threw his own birthday party at Gunther Goat Cheese's. His "closest friends" were there - the restaurant's animatronics: Count Wolfgang, Betty the She-Boar, Rat-Putin, and the Lice Twins, Olga and Chicago Joe. A restaurant employee in a Gunther Goat Cheese mascot costume arrives at Heinz's table, but, stunned at Heinz being the only one there, nonchalantly placed Heinz's Doonkelberry birthday cake on the table and left. He then shouted out to Heinz "Hey kid, lock up when you're done, 'kay!". At night, Heinz ran home with the cake in hands, and was attacked by a swarm of Doonkelberry bats, who naturally eat Doonkelberries.

                When Heinz was younger, he performed magic tricks for the local kids. Heinz performed the pull-the-rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick, and instead of pulling out his rabbit companion, Bobo, he pulled out a skunk, which sprayed him. Next, he performed a card trick. A girl volunteered to pick one of Heinz's cards, while he blindfolded himself. When Heinz uncovered his blindfold, he appeared to be holding the same skunk, who sprayed him again. Yet again, another trick went wrong, and while Heinz shouted for someone to help him get out of some chains, the skunk came along and sprayed him once more.

                    Heinz watched his father come home with a brand new puppy that he won him in a game of "Poke the Goozim With a Stick". The puppy was named "Only Son", because it was like the son that Heinz's father never had. Only Son became a famous dog, which brought fame and fortune to the Doofenshmirtz family. After this, Heinz was still forced to be the lawn gnome.

                After trapping Perry in sticky flypaper, Doofenshmirtz tells him a story about a moment from his childhood when a bully named Boris would always kick sand into his face. Everywhere he went, sand was kicked into his face. Due to these events, he became paranoid and felt that sand would be kicked at him at any time. Except at the beach when he was expecting it, but didn't. Even when that happened, he was still scared of it.

                    Perry arrives at Doofenshmirtz's space station, shaped like a giant robot with huge hands and nothing below the waist. He gets sucked inside the robot and frozen in an ice cube tray by Doofenshmirtz. Using a crane on a track, Doofenshmirtz shows Perry the Platypus his station while telling him a story from his teen years. It seems Doofenshmirtz was very adept at hand shadows, or shadow puppets. He found it great fun for entertaining people and meeting girls (Fräuleins). Unfortunately Heinz's fun was ruined when a new boy arrived by the name of Hans. His puppetry wasn't very good, but that didn't stop him from taking away the girl that Heinz was trying to win over. He never did a shadow puppet again.

                When Doofenshmirtz was young, he built his first inator, but it lost to a kid with a baking soda volcano. The next year, Doofenshmirtz made an even bigger inator, but lost again to another kid with a baking soda volcano. When he got older, he was into poetry: "The movies are gray/The TV is black/The horses are running/Please bring me some food." Yet, he still lost to another baking soda volcano.
